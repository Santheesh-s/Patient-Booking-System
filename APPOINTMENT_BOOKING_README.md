   - Implement service/provider/availability management UI
   - Add patient history view
   - Create audit logs
   - Add analytics dashboard

5. **Deployment**
   - Deploy to Netlify, Vercel, or similar

   - Set up CI/CD pipeline
   - Monitor error logging (Sentry)

## 📊 Data Schema

### Collections

**Services**
- name, description, duration (minutes)
- providers (array of provider IDs)
- customFields (array of form fields)

**Providers**
- name, email, phone, speciality
- services (array of service IDs)

**Availability**
- providerId
- businessHours (day of week, start/end times)
- blockedDates (holidays, vacation)

**Appointments**
- patientName, patientEmail, patientPhone
- serviceId, providerId
- startTime, endTime
- customFieldValues
- status (pending, confirmed, completed, cancelled)

**Users**
- email, password (hashed)
- role (admin, provider, staff)
- providerId (for provider role)

## 🔄 Booking Flow

1. **Service Selection** - Patient picks service
2. **Provider Selection** - Patient picks provider offering service
3. **Date Selection** - Patient picks date (next 30 days)
4. **Slot Selection** - Show 8 random available slots for that date
5. **Details** - Collect patient info and custom fields
6. **Confirmation** - Show confirmation and send email

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Slot Generation Algorithm

The system displays **8 random available slots** per day:

1. Get provider's business hours for that day
2. Fetch all confirmed/pending appointments
3. Generate all possible slots (30-min intervals by default)
4. Filter out conflicts
5. Shuffle and return first 8

This creates variety and encourages quick booking.

### Business Hours

Set per-provider per-day-of-week:
- Monday-Friday: 9am-5pm
- Saturday-Sunday: Closed

Customizable in admin (future feature).

## 🤝 Integration Points

Ready to integrate with:
- Email services (SendGrid, Mailgun)
- SMS providers (Twilio)
- Calendar systems (Google Calendar, Outlook)
- Billing systems (Stripe, PayPal)
- Electronic Health Records (EHR)
- Customer relationship management (CRM)

## 📝 Notes

- No patient online cancellation (call clinic to cancel)
- Clear messaging about cancellation policy
- Demo credentials are intentionally simple
- All times stored as ISO 8601 strings
- MongoDB document IDs used for referential integrity

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### No Services Showing
1. Visit `/setup` to initialize database
2. Check MongoDB connection
3. Verify database name is "book"

### Login Not Working
1. Run `/api/init` first to create admin user
2. Use demo credentials: admin@clinic.com / admin123
3. Check auth token in localStorage

### Slots Not Showing
1. Ensure provider has business hours set
2. Check availability collection in MongoDB
3. Verify date is not blocked
4. Make sure slots within 30 days
